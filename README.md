# [React Portfolio]()

## Description

Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my portfolio. I am currently finishing up a certificate from the University of Washington's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp and am hoping to transition into software engineering as a career. As I begin my job search, I needed a place to be able to showcase my work for potential employers. I built this site using React, which honestly might end up being one of my favorite technology's that I've worked with so far. I find breaking up code into reuseable components to be fun and exremely useful in saving time and developing an overall style.
