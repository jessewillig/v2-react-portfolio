# [React Portfolio]()

## Description

Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my portfolio. I am currently finishing up a certificate from the University of Washington's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp and am hoping to transition into software engineering as a career. As I begin my job search, I needed a place to be able to showcase my work for potential employers. I built this site using React, which honestly might end up being one of my favorite technology's that I've worked with so far. I find breaking up code into reuseable components to be fun and exremely useful in saving time and developing an overall style.

From my portfolio, one can reach about me, view my resume, see my technical skills and review links to my LinkedIn and GitHub. In the Portfolio section one is able to find descriptions of my recent projects as well as links to the GitHub repositories and deployed sites. 

Thanks for checking it out!
